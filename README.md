## Installation

To use these scripts, you'll need to have PowerShell installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of PowerShell from the [official website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell).

Once you have PowerShell installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/muzabol2/powershell-scripts.git
```

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. To run a script, navigate to the directory where the script is located and type the following command in your PowerShell console:
```
.\script-name.ps1
```
Replace `script-name.ps1` with the name of the script you want to run.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find a bug or have an idea for a new script, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
